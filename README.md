## Background

This is the fifth event in the Datawhale and Tianchi series - "Data Analytics for Beginners".

The question is based on the background of data analysis, and the contestants are required to complete the corresponding data analysis operations using publicly available arXiv papers. Unlike the previous data mining competition, this competition not only requires players to model the data, but also requires them to use the data in the competition to complete a specific visual analysis.

The complete study of this program will help to master the basic skills of data analysis. We will also provide an exclusive live video learning channel.

## Task Schedule
- `Task 1`: statistics on the number of papers (data statistics task): statistics on the number of papers in all directions of computing, throughout 2019.
- `Task 2`: statistics on the authors of papers (data statistical task): statistics on the names of the authors of all papers appearing in the Top 10 of the evaluation rate.
- `Task 3`: thesis code statistics (data statistics task): statistics on the proportion of papers containing source code under all thesis categories.
- ` Task 4`: paper classification (data modeling task): category classification of new papers using existing data modeling.
- ` Task 5`: authorship association (data modeling task): modeling the authorship relationships of papers and counting the most frequent authorship relationships.



Scoring rules for the formal stage: based on the participants' public code in the Tianchi Forum and the number of posts STAR at the end of the formal round (fork if STAR is the same, views if FORK is the same).

### Long-term competition

After the official contest, this contest will be open for a long time with no time limit for registration and entry.
Each participant can submit 3 times per day to complete the preliminary scoring; the leaderboard will be updated hourly and sorted from highest to lowest score according to the evaluation index; the leaderboard will select the best historical score for display.

## Competition data
### Data description

arXiv is an important public academic website and a great tool for searching, browsing and downloading academic papers. arXiv papers cover a very wide range of topics, covering a huge branch of physics and many sub-disciplines of computer science, such as mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology and economics, among others.
